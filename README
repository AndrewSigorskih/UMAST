Input
-----
Two trees in Newick format.

------
Output
------
stdout: distance between trees calculated as number of leaves in resulting 
agreement subtree or L-distance between input trees.

umast.tre: file containing maximum agreement subtree in Newick format.

umast.log: text file containing log information about run.

Command line arguments
----------------------

-r option for rooted trees

-o path to resulting (u)mast tree file, default umast.tre

-l path to log file, default umast.log

-d Print L-distance to stdout instead of agreement subtree size.
